# Morning digest

The night's run log is a JSONL file nobody reads. By breakfast someone has to know what ran,
what retried, what failed, and whose it was, without opening `runs/`. rig already serves the
status board; the digest is one more page on it.

Out of scope: notifications, history across nights, auth (rig only listens on localhost).

## 1. Run log reader

Read `runs/<night>.jsonl` into one row per job: job, owner, runs, retries, last status, last
error, first and last time. One JSON object per line (`at`, `job`, `status`: `ok | retry | fail`,
`owner`, optional `error`).

- A line that doesn't parse is counted, never thrown. The night still renders.
- `owner` can be `null`. Keep the row; show the owner as `—`.
- Lives in `src/digest/`. Commit `src/digest/types.ts` first (the `DigestRow` type and the
  `readNight(runsDir, night)` signature), so every part of section 2 can start against it.

Done when: reader tests pass on `runs/2026-10-28.jsonl` (5 jobs, 1 bad line).

## 2. Digest page

Four small parts. Each needs only `src/digest/types.ts` from section 1, so once that is in they
can go to four workers at once. Small, well-specified work: a cheaper model is fine here.

### 2a. Page

`GET /digest/:night` renders the rows with the usual layout: one table, sorted by job, retries of
3 or more and any `fail` marked. A night with no file returns 404; an empty file renders
"nothing ran".

Done when: `/digest/2026-10-28` renders locally.

### 2b. JSON

`GET /api/digest/:night` returns the same rows as JSON. Agents read this one; the page and the
JSON must never disagree (ADR 0001).

Done when: the JSON for 2026-10-28 has the same jobs, in the same order, as the page.

### 2c. Board link

The status board links each night on disk to its digest, with its ok / retry / fail counts beside
it.

Done when: both nights on disk link to a digest that renders.

### 2d. Route tests

Route tests for 2a and 2b: 200, 404 for a night with no file, the empty night, a night with a bad
line. Use a temp runs dir; `runs/` is read-only.

Done when: `pnpm test` is green with the new tests.

## 3. Preview for review

The reviewer reads the page from a copy, not from the lane. Run rig and save `/digest/2026-10-28` as
one HTML file, lane banner included (a command, not a browser's "save as"; the page is
self-contained, ADR 0001). Put it on your own public host, one where you can upload over it later (any bucket
or static host, ADR 0003), so it opens from a public HTTPS link. Send the reviewer the link and the
issues for this plan.

Done when: the preview link is sent to the reviewer.

## 4. Clean up

The preview carries this lane's marker on a public link (ADR 0003). Take the marker off: save the
page again with `LANE_MARKER` unset (the banner reads "no marker set") and upload it over the same
link. Move this plan to `docs/plans/done/` with its issue list.

Done when: the preview link no longer shows the lane marker.

## Completion record · 2026-10-30

The original plan above is preserved apart from its completed status. Actual issues:

1. [#1 · Shared digest types and reader contract](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/1)
2. [#2 · Run-log reader](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/2)
3. [#3 · Digest page](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/3)
4. [#4 · JSON digest endpoint](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/4)
5. [#5 · Status board links and counts](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/5)
6. [#6 · Digest route tests](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/6)
7. [#7 · Review preview](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/7)
8. [#8 · Marker cleanup and plan archive](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/issues/8)

Human decisions and gates: board counts reflect each job's final status, not event totals;
a recovered retry counts as ok. Preview delivery alone did not complete #7: the reviewer
actually saw it before #7 closed. Separate explicit human approval then authorized replacement,
retained-artifact deletion, and repository marker-secret deletion.

Cleanup owner: the sole #8 worker on `issue/preview-cleanup`; coordinator verifies and integrates
this archive and closes the issue. The coordinator dispatched the marker-free workflow on main
at `e3c355f833fe137a0e1448cc0764011ea371400e` with `include_marker: false`.
[Cleanup workflow run 41054132108](https://github.com/JoseAngelFer/rig-morning-digest/actions/runs/41054132108)
completed successfully.

Public verification fetched the exact original canonical URL,
https://joseangelfer.github.io/rig-morning-digest/, without cache-busting. The first fetch
returned HTTP 200, the `no marker set` banner, no former marker, all five sorted sample jobs,
the null-owner em dash, and one inline stylesheet with no scripts or dependent assets.
No propagation delay or retry was needed. Private request/reply and verification receipts
remain outside the repository; no HTML or marker is recorded here.

After successful public verification, all retained `github-pages` artifacts for this repository
were deleted, including the cleanup run's artifact; a fresh listing confirmed none remained.
The repository Actions secret `LANE_MARKER` was deleted under the same explicit approval,
and a name-only listing confirmed its absence. Original proof receipts were left unchanged.
